# Windows Form application

The application tier is based on .NET technology and DataSet, while the Data Tier is based on the relational database which we created in Data Modeler. 
To show the presentational tier we are using Windows Form application from Visual Studio 2019. 
The essence of the application itself is the record of student status in enrolled courses.
